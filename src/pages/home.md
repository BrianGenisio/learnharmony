Welcome to LearnHarmony.org.  This site is designed to help you learn the new features of ES6 through examples and exploration.  This site is in the early phases, so for now, just play along in the editor.  It uses Traceur, so any features that Traceur supports should work here.  Write to the console, have some fun.

Over the next several weeks, I will start to put up micro-lessons designed to teach individual features.  Come back often! I expect it to be fun.
