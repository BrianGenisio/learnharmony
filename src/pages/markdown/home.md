Welcome to LearnHarmony.org.  This site is designed to help you learn the new features of ECMAScript (primarily ES6 for now) through examples and exploration.  This site is in the early phases, so for now, just play along in the editor.  It uses [Babel](http://babeljs.io), so any features that Babel supports should work here.  Write to the console, have some fun.

Over the next several weeks, I will start to put up micro-lessons designed to teach individual features.  Come back often! I expect it to be fun.
