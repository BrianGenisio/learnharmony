## Examples

Here you will find different types of bit loader setups to illustrate how to configure core hooks and plugins. There are a few different sample applications to show what kinds of things you can do with bit loader.

These examples run in node, so you need to first install dependencies and then run the particular example.  From this examples directory, run the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ node asyncfile
```

That will install the dependencies and run the `asyncfile` example.  Now that you have the dependencies installed, you can just run all other examples.

```
$ node taskrunner
$ node fetch-hook
$ node babel-plugin
```
