This site was created by [Brian Genisio](http://briangenisio.com) and [Miguel Castillo](https://github.com/MiguelCastillo) as a mechanism to learn ES6 and teach others about it.  The code for this site is written in ES6 using [Babel](http://babeljs.io) for transpiling in the browser and [bit imports](http://github.com/miguelcastillo/bit-imports) for the module loader.  The source is available on [Github](http://www.github.com/BrianGenisio/LearnHarmony)

Have Fun!
