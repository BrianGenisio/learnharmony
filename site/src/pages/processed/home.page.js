This site is in the early phases, so for now, just play along in the editor.  It uses <a href=\"http://babeljs.io\">Babel</a>, so any features that Babel supports should work here.  Write to the console, have some fun.</p>\n<p>Over the next several weeks, I will start to put up micro-lessons designed to teach individual features.  Come back often! I expect it to be fun.</p>\n"
